### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! I'm doing my undergraduate and master's degree at Stanford in Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering, respectively. My research code is in a private repository right now, but will be published publicly soon!

I'm developing my personal website here: https://github.com/xiavincent
